Angular
It is based on MVC concept. It has its own controller, HTTP module, and services.
It is based on TypeScript instead of JavaScript to make the framework typed.
It is a component based framework.
It uses service to share data between the component.

Angular CLI
$ ng new applicationName
  ng new myapp = This is used to create the new angular application.
  ng server = this will run the new server
  ng build = This will build out our asset
  ng generate component todos = it is use to generate the new components, service or modules
  ng generate module app-routing
  ng generate service todo

  To install Angular
  First install node.js then run below commands

  sudo npm install -g @angular/cli

NOTE: sudo is to get the root access and -g is for the global.

Creating new application
ng new angular-crash-todolist
If we say yes to routing it will create the routing module

ng serve --open (This will run the dev server and open in browser)

in index.html <app-root> tag is embedding the root app component. All our custom components goes under <app-root>

app folder has all the components server module etc.

file app.module.ts file is the entry point for angular. This file has below module by default

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent === This place all the components goes. If you are using CLI then CLI will take care of adding those details here.
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    AppRoutingModule == If you want to use any external module you need to include those modules here and at the top with import statements.
  ],
  providers: [], = The service that we want to include.
  bootstrap: [AppComponent] = This just bootstrap the main app component.
})

ng generate component components/todos = This command will create a new component in components folder.

constructor will use to import services
ngOnInit is use to do all other things which we need to do while loading the component.
